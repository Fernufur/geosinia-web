###### —//[[Characters/Main/Mateo\|Mateo]]//–—–-·

I can’t see anything and I feel numb, but I know I’m lying down. Cold dirt and occasional fluffy moss touch my bare skin, and grasses seemed to curl around me. The surrounding damp fog making it feel like a weight on my body, and the freezing cold air burning my nostrils with every breath.
There’s a sharp pain in my chest, like something had been digging into my ribcage. My muscles left aching as if I’d overexerted them far beyond their limits. I try to open my eyes but can only squint because of the light trying to burn into my retinas; attempts to turn my head never come to fruition. The numbness in my hands fades and I can feel them beginning to move, but with that pin prickling and static feeling when they fall asleep making my muscles cramp with every movement. I frantically rummage around me in the dirt for any of my belongings, my first aid kit, tool bag, or even the camera bag. My hands dig through dirt and throw around the ferns and twigs around me until I feel a strung fabric just at the end of my reach.
I use whatever energy I can muster just to stretch my arm enough to grab it, every muscle burning as I yank the strap towards me. A textured black strap, barely visible, connecting to a satchel. It’s my camera bag...

The wind gets louder, whistling between the trees as they bend and contort, while the plants seem to cry and mourn.
“hunb ujn-biuon dugnjd” The attempt to speak was a complete mess, even ignoring how raspy and dry my throat is causing my voice to crack.

I feel like someone is watching me; a chill runs down my spine. I want only to rise, yet remain immobile, my gaze fixed. Eyes stare back. The soft rustle of bushes intensifies, but the eyes stay unmoving. I slowly bring my head up and start searching for my phone on the forest floor. The gaze of those eyes falters the more I move my body, eventually disappearing after getting myself to sit up.
I see my phone sitting next to my tool bag just past a tree to my right, flopping to my side and crawling over to it.
‘1:41 am’
Confusion sets in before fear.
A jarring tear shoots through my spine and neck. I feel the adrenaline rush through my veins, the burn coursing through my muscles. I pull my body to sit against a tree and get a full look at myself, bruises and scrapes under the tattered remains of clothes, and insectile arms wrapping against my chest.
My eyes go wide and my mind panics at the sight
*Do something! Do anything!*
Every urge and demand seems to be ignored by my body.
***MOVE***
Like a command, my body lurches forward. My limbs flailing as my body forces itself across the forest floor, the scratching of sticks on my skin and the shock of limbs crashing into tree roots. The flex and contortions of arms and fingers as if reaching for something. My right hand crashes into the dirt, my fingers digging into the soil and leaves. My hand lifts and the dirt falls through my fingers. Leaving what looks like a small marble, clear with a swirl of green ish blue inside.
***EAT***
The command rages through my mind like a thundering storm. I try to refuse but this scares me, my own mind ignoring me.
The pain in my arm suddenly screams as it flexes and swings towards me with my jaw snapping open.

…

It's quiet.
The rustles and ambiance of the forest fill my ears.
My body aches, it burns.
I lay on my back hoping for sleep, or death.
The pain seeps into my bones and leaves me weak.
I open my eyes and stare at the stars.
*As I wallow in the feeling of something writhing inside me.*

###### —//[[Characters/Main/AZ\|AZ]]//–—–-·

The gentle warmth of the sun woke me up, surprisingly it wasn't the obnoxious people I share a dorm hall with. I remembered it was a Sunday though. Everyone either left already, slept in or is just being quiet, I would sleep more but eh. Waking up in the late afternoon is already enough.
I get out of bed and- ough, there's that lightheadedness and I can feel how uncomfortably dry  my skin is. I steady my body and regain my balance as I walk to the bathroom, as routine I ask through the closed door if my roommate is there.
"Hey [[Characters/Side/Jess\|Jess]], you done in there?"
I pause at the silence expecting answer, Oh wait. I forgot he left to his parents house on Friday. Now I just look stupid talking to a door. My bathroom routine starts once I close the door behind me, relieve, wash, pick at scales, clean teeth. While looking in the mirror while cleaning my teeth I notice that some of my skin is cracking, there's the insane bags under my eyes but I continue to ignore that daily. 
Returning to the main room I grab a couple oranges to take with me and as I'm reaching for the door to leave, I see my very bare legs. Damn I went to sleep in just a shirt, the walk of idiocy and nakedness back to my room to find clothes to wear. While I'm in my room I check the calendar on my desk, nothing planned today, so… I mean I'll figure out something to do. Feeling the dryness of my scales again I decide to just go to the pool.
Now I grab those oranges again and head out the door. The quiet walk through the hallway weirdly comforts me and the soft humming music in the elevator vaguely continues that calm, once the doors open again I can hear people socializing in the common room down the hall. I go just to see if anyone I know is there. I turn the corner and immediately see [[Mila\|Mila]] with a bit of searching around I also see [[Characters/Secondary/Elaine\|Elaine]]. Which is… kinda surprising, Elaine tends to be socially reserved so I end up going over to her.

"Weird to see you here with so many people." Realizing only after I said it that it sounds a little condescending.
"To be honest, Ceren dragged me out here. Said she wanted me to meet one her trans friends, cause y'know."
"Well did you?"
"Yeah… they were interesting." I could tell by the tone that she didn't like them.
"Okay what did they do?"
"He was the specific kind of trans that tries to make it everyone's business. It felt like they liked being labeled trans more than being a guy"
"Ohh I get it then, similar to people that make their sexuality their whole personality?"
"Pretty much."
By that time Mila had come up and was happily surprised that I was here.
"AZ!! How are you buddy?" She was definitely excited about something
"I've been doing fine since I woke up, decided that I was gonna come down and get in the pool"
"Nice, all though I do need to tell Elaine something in private." She's hiding something isn't she.
"Huh?" Elaine is definitely confused but doesn't really bother arguing.
"Well you'll know where I'll be" I'm a little disappointed that the conversation was cut short and like that but I don't want to intrude if something is personal.
I walk to the other side of the room and vaguely hear bits of what Mila is saying
"So you've heard… -ren right? …big shark girl- crush… him"
I immediately stop
Please don't be what I think it is, please don't be her. I exit and set my stuff down on a table trying not to think about what I heard. I'm hoping I misheard the name, hoping that their talking about a different shark girl. Hell if it is her then maybe she has a crush of someone else, no then Mila wouldn't have asked me to leave. What am I supposed to do???

Water. All my panicking and pacing around made me accidentally step off the side into the water. It feels really nice, I'm glad that this pool is deep enough for me to properly swim in. While circling underwater I get a feeling that my breathing is restricted. I check the gills on my neck and they're fine, I check the ones on my torso… I still have my shirt on. I get out, take it off and stretch my gills to get them open before diving back in. Resurfacing to watch the sunset transition to twilight.
"It's beautiful" I hear Elaine behind me, she's sitting on the edge near me.
"One day I'll be way up there" I turn and gaze at the stars.
*As I imagine floating in space.*
