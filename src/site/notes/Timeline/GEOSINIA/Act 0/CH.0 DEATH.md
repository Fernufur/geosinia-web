Inside of the [[Locations/3rd plane/L. Reliquary\|L. Reliquary]],
[[Characters/Main/C. Fern\|C. Fern]] battered and laid on the floor while [[Characters/Main/C. AZ\|C. AZ]] panics to close her wounds, the sight of [[Characters/Main/C. Astra\|C. Astra]]'s death with his limbs torn away and body thrown to the side, with [[Characters/Main/C. Azeal\|C. Azeal]] frozen in place. [[Characters/Main/C. XVII (Seth)\|C. XVII (Seth)]] launches himself towards [[Characters/Relics/C. Rociv\|C. Rociv]]

"Do you have no respect for life!?" Seth muttered.
"He was a thief, stealing the gift from OUR father. He was nothing, now he's even more worthless." Rociv exclaimed.

With Seth closing the distance between himself and Rociv, he sees everyone else looking at him in horror. Azeal running towards him and reaching for Seth, but he wasn't fast enough. Rociv snatches Seth out of the air, Seth yells in pain from the pressure being put onto his body. With the pain keeping him awake, he tries to fire a cannon shell at Rociv but his body has already started dying due to the radiation emitting from Rociv himself, he's losing consciousness.

"SETH!" Azeal called out as he lunged onto Rociv and ripped Seth out of his grasp. "Astra was never worthless." as he breaks of a piece of his arm  and smashed a glass capsule on the metal "EYES!" yelling to everyone else.

The torn limb is thrown at Rociv and combusts acting like a flare, burning a blinding white and green fire. Azeal pushes himself backwards to move to a further distance to recuperate.

"IM A GOD, I NEED NOT THE ABILITY TO SEE JUST TO KILL YOU!" Rociv laughs manically as he moves through the smoke and fire, charging towards Azeal. 

"AZEAL DUCK!" Seth yells from behind Azeal, to which he trusts. after the sounds of clicking and sparks a blade of light flies above Azeal and into Rociv's head. "Azeal move, I can still see." Seth's push forwards was cut short by Rociv moving down the blade reaching for him.

"Your little party tricks mean nothing." Rociv shatters the blade and reaches to crush Seth's leg. "I'm sorry everyone." Azeal mumbles before unlatching his armor and shattering every acid filled capsule he had, he grabs Rociv as his body fuels a massive explosion. He recovers from the blast and charges at Rociv still set ablaze, while his body burns away he stabs at his chest with his mind racing.

"GLORY TO GEOS-" Azeal's core is crushed in Rociv's hand, killing him.
