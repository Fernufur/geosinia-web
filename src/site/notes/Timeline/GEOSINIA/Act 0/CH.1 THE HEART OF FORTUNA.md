"The [[Technology/Transportation/T. Intershot\|T. Intershot]]. The revolutionary transportation line between planets, connecting the peoples from [[Locations/2nd plane/Fortuna/L. Fortuna\|L. Fortuna]] to as far as [[Locations/2nd plane/Irene/L. Irene\|L. Irene]]. Do you need to get to another planet? Take one of our lines depending on what your intent is, need a vacation? takes one of our lines to the [[Locations/2nd plane/Fortuna/Continents/Aurelia/L. Fortunian Grand Ridge\|L. Fortunian Grand Ridge]]. Taking a research trip? Use our private lines meant for certain activities. Are you immigrating? We have lines for that!" The passenger TV drones, playing a mix of ads and videos about the Intershot itself on loop.
*Its been 6 hours of mostly being locked to this chair, requiring permission to get up no matter what the reason is. I've never been this still for this long.*

*I hope this decision was right.*


*I woke up a bit ago and there's still the same sight outside the window, the massive planet that [[Locations/2nd plane/Leukothea/L. Leukothea\|L. Leukothea]] is. As the twilight line crosses over the planet you can see the lights of cities turning on, showing a web of string lights across the surface. Even through the night the beauty still shows, I wonder what the surface is like.*

"Excuse me, are you ready for the depot landing?" [[Characters/Secondary/C. char 1\|C. char 1]] came up to [[Characters/Main/C. Azeal\|C. Azeal]], they sat in front and latched the belts across their various limbs. "I know you don't understand [[Languages/LN. Elnish\|LN. Elnish]] but some of the people boarding can help you learn. Just ask."

*It's difficult to communicate with everyone else, they have bodies with mass, proper limbs, and a face to convey emotion and intent. I cant understand the worker and they seem to know that too, and since no one knows my language so I've been taught a couple of words in "Elnish". Most importantly ways to get people's attention, how to ask for help, and directions. I'm supposed to have an escort on Fortuna waiting for me, purely because I'm one of the first of my kind to immigrate to Fortuna or Leukothea.*

"The depot should catch us any second now" **char 1** says as they brace their body.
*I just nod, hoping it meant well.*

In seconds the body of the craft jolts and Azeal gets shaken loose from his chair. wrapping their body around the belts and chair holding on while the craft gets realigned from the depot arm catching it. The force made **char 1** pass out, their body limp with the chair being all that's keeping them safe. With Azeal showing fear clutching to anything solid while the craft settles into place.
'ELEVEN PASSENGERS NOW BOARDING' The announcement speaker goes off, with more people boarding the announcements go on continuing and eventually explaining the seating process. 'Put any belongings into the cargo chute to be set in the storage hold, find your seat and latch every belt to the specified limb shown in the pictures sewn to each. Times of free movement will be announced.'

*Two of them are walking closer, with a look of confusion at the sight of me. They look to be disturbed by my presence, to which the worker notices the two and starts explaining what they can about me.*

"Oh this is Azeal, they're the third [[Species/SP. Metalin\|SP. Metalin]] from Irene to be immigrating to Fortuna. I've been teaching them a few words so they can get a start at least." The two others looking at least semi responsive. "But keep in mind not to touch his actual body, the metal is hot and can burn you pretty bad."

*That immediately set them off, you could see their discomfort that they have to sit next to someone who they cant understand and can potentially burn and injure them with ease. I wouldn't blame them either.* 

The two strangers reluctantly take their seats being hesitant to get near Azeal. **char 1** attempts to start light conversation with the them to his failure, while Azeal zones out.

"What's with those from Irene trying to taint everywhere else." The first stranger speaking in [[Languages/LN. Kaltor\|LN. Kaltor]] as to not be understood. "They can stay where they belong, they're dangerous to everyone else."
"I mean yeah, they were just discovered recently. We don't know how they act." The second stranger nervously says. "They still structure themselves in tribes; they could be feral."
The racist remarks continue as the worker gets more visibly annoyed the longer the conversion holds out. They reach out to grab a bottle and slowly open it, before shaking the bottle and throwing the liquid out at the two strangers.
"Its disappointing that you already hate that Metalins exist, what have they done to you." **char 1** now pissed at the two for believing that Azeal and other's like him don't deserve a chance.

"Sir." A fairly tall pale white cat wearing a ruffled suit with a black vest stood above the four of them, He held out 2 pass tickets covered in red "DENY" stamps. "you two need to come with me to discuss your intent."

"WHAT?? We were cleared for boarding, and-" The first stranger tries to combat the statement before being cut off.
"Both of you, come here." Being intimidated the two eventually comply.

*Who is this? He's taking the other two into the center corridor.*

'PLEASE ENSURE SECUREMENT AND PREPARE FOR SKYBREAK' The announcements blared and to the horror of the two strangers they were outside of the capsule and unsecured.


"What about our intent!? We're just travelling back to Fortuna!" They were getting anxious due to not being in a safe position out of their chairs. "We need to get back in our chairs!"
"Wait." The word 'SKYBREAK' show on all the announcement screens and the the cat just grabbed the floor to ceiling railing. "Have fun"

The arm holding the craft starts to spin increasing in speed over time, the spin pulls the two strangers to the back wall in the corridor compressing their bodies against it. The cat stands still, unaffected by the situation, **char 1** stares in disbelief questioning what just happened and how he just stood there. The cat waved to Azeal before walking into the capsule, he sat down and unruffled his suit.

"I don't excuse racism" He spoke in [[Languages/LN. Ire\|LN. Ire]] this time so Azeal could fully understand him. *He can speak Ire??* "Oh right, I'm [[Characters/Anomalies/C. Val\|C. Val]]. Don't tell anyone but [[Characters/Anomalies\|Anomalies]] like me exist."

"What do you mean anomalies?" Azeal nervously questions Val hoping for an answer that he never gets.
"Just watch out, and stay safe" Val walks out of the capsule after flicking the **char 1**'s forehead.

The Intershot exits the atmosphere and starts speeding up to reach a cruising speed, while blood starts flowing down the center corridor. He looks around the corner to see a crumpled mass of flesh sliding off the wall at the end of the hall. The worker wakes back up and seems to have forgotten about the two and Val.

*Wait, where's the blood? the mass is gone too, how does that just disappear??*
The corridor was now suddenly clean leaving no remnant of the corpses there previously. Azeal eventually goes back to looking out of the window after seemingly forgetting that something happened. As the view of Leukothea wanes [[Locations/2nd plane/Lux Nova\|Lux Nova]] comes into view. The star showing the day side of Leukothea and Fortuna in the distance.

*I think i'll just rest until we land on Fortuna.*

The hiss from the capsule door wakes up Azeal, as the door slides open light fills the space. For a couple seconds the only sight is the pure white light until eyes adjust.

The [[Locations/2nd plane/Fortuna/Continents/Celaris/Country 1/Province 1/Cities/Crest/L. Arc of Fortune\|L. Arc of Fortune]] station floor, Azeal climbs out and onto the platform seeing hundreds of people getting on or off the different intershot crafts. With the urge to wander and explore the area Azeal leaves the platform and enters the [[Locations/2nd plane/Fortuna/Continents/Celaris/Country 1/Province 1/Cities/Crest/L. Bankside\|L. Bankside]] district in the city [[Locations/2nd plane/Fortuna/Continents/Celaris/Country 1/Province 1/Cities/L. Teinsk\|L. Teinsk]], leaving **char 1** behind.
