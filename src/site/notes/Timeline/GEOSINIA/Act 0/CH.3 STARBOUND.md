###### TF You Mean TLDR!?
NIGHTMARE! NIGHTMARE! NIGHTMARE! NIGHTMARE! NIGHTMARE!

Given that Azeal's body cant touch or interact with most things, he searches for a way to make his surrounding smoke more dense in places so he can grab things. Through other people he hears about a tinkerer on Ixion who could make something for him, the problem is that Ixion is another planet and it doesn't have good relations with the others. So AZ's friend Astra has been making a starship and can help take him there.
