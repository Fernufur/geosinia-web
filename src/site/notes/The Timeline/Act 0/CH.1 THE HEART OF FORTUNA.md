"The [[Technology/Transportation/T. Intershot\|T. Intershot]]. The revolutionary transportation line between planets, connecting the peoples from [[Locations/2nd plane/Fortuna/L. Fortuna\|L. Fortuna]] to as far as [[Locations/2nd plane/Irene/L. Irene\|L. Irene]]. Do you need to get to another planet? Take one of our lines depending on what your intent is, need a vacation? takes one of our lines to the [[Locations/2nd plane/Fortuna/Continents/Aurelia/L. Fortunian Grand Ridge\|L. Fortunian Grand Ridge]]. Taking a research trip? Use our private lines meant for certain activities. Are you immigrating? We have lines for that!" The passenger TV drones, playing a mix of ads and videos about the Intershot itself on loop.
*Its been 6 hours of mostly being locked to this chair, requiring permission to get up no matter what the reason is. I've never been this still for this long.*

*I hope this decision was right.*


*I woke up a bit ago and there's still the same sight outside the window, the massive planet that [[Locations/2nd plane/Leukothea/L. Leukothea\|L. Leukothea]] is. As the twilight line crosses over the planet you can see the lights of cities turning on, showing a web of string lights across the surface. Even through the night the beauty still shows, I wonder what the surface is like.*

"Excuse me, are you ready for the depot landing?" A worker came up to Azeal, they sat in front and latched the belts across their various limbs. "I know you don't understand [[Languages/LN. Elnish\|LN. Elnish]] but some of the people boarding can help you learn. Just ask."

*It's difficult to communicate with everyone else, they have bodies with mass, proper limbs, and a face to convey emotion and intent. I cant understand the worker and they seem to know that too, and since no one knows my language so I've been taught a couple of words in "Elnish". Most importantly ways to get people's attention, how to ask for help, and directions. I'm supposed to have an escort on Fortuna waiting for me, purely because I'm one of the first of my kind to immigrate to Fortuna or Leukothea.*

"The depot should catch us any second now" The worker says as they brace their body.
*I just nod, hoping it meant well.*

In seconds the body of the craft jolts and Azeal gets shaken loose from his chair. wrapping their body around the belts and chair holding on while the craft gets realigned from the depot arm catching it. The force made the worker pass out, their body limp with the chair being all that's keeping them safe. With Azeal showing fear clutching to anything solid while the craft settles into place.
'ELEVEN PASSENGERS NOW BOARDING' The announcement speaker goes off, with more people boarding the announcements go on continuing and eventually explaining the seating process. 'Put any belongings into the cargo chute to be set in the storage hold, find your seat and latch every belt to the specified limb shown in the pictures sewn to each. Times of free movement will be announced.'

*Two of them are walking closer, with a look of confusion at the sight of me. They look to be disturbed by my presence, to which the worker notices the two and starts explaining what they can about me.*

"Oh this is Azeal, they're the third [[Species/SP. Metalin\|SP. Metalin]] from Irene to be immigrating to Fortuna. I've been teaching them a few words so they can get a start at least." The two others looking at least semi responsive. "But keep in mind not to touch his actual body, the metal is hot and can burn you pretty bad."

*That immediately set them off, you could see their discomfort that they have to sit next to someone who they cant understand and can potentially burn and injure them with ease. I wouldn't blame them either.* 

The two strangers reluctantly take their seats
